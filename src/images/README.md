# Image Assets Directory

This directory contains all the images used in the static site. The structure is organized as follows:

## Directory Structure

- `/hero/` - Hero section background images and featured images
  - Required: `hero-bg.jpg` (1920x1080px recommended)
  
- `/logo/` - Logo and branding assets
  - Required: `logo.png` (200x80px recommended)
  
- `/blog/` - Blog post images and thumbnails
  - Recommended size: 800x600px for blog post featured images

## Image Requirements

1. **File Formats**
   - Use `.jpg` for photographs and complex images
   - Use `.png` for logos and images requiring transparency
   - Use `.svg` for icons and scalable graphics

2. **Optimization**
   - Compress all images appropriately before deployment
   - Keep individual file sizes under 500KB when possible
   - Use modern formats (WebP) with fallbacks when needed

3. **Naming Convention**
   - Use lowercase letters
   - Use hyphens for spaces
   - Include descriptive names (e.g., `eco-friendly-cups.jpg`)

## Placeholder Images
Currently using placeholder images. Replace with actual brand assets before deployment:
- `hero-bg.jpg` - Hero section background
- `logo.png` - Company logo
