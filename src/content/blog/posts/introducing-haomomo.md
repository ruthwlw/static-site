# Introducing Haomomo: A Plastic-Free Future for Your Little Ones

As parents, we all want the best for our children. We carefully choose their food, their clothes, and their toys. But have you ever stopped to think about the cups they drink from? Most baby cups today are made from plastic, which can leach harmful chemicals into their drinks and contribute to environmental waste.

## Our Journey

The idea for Haomomo was born from a simple observation: while we're all trying to reduce plastic use in our lives, baby products remain heavily dependent on plastic materials. As parents ourselves, we wanted to create something better â€“ cups that are safe for our children and kind to our planet.

### Why Plastic-Free Matters

- **Health Benefits**: No BPA, phthalates, or other harmful chemicals
- **Environmental Impact**: Fully biodegradable and sustainable
- **Durability**: Built to last and pass down to siblings
- **Peace of Mind**: Protect your children's health

## Our Materials

We've carefully selected materials that are:

1. 100% plastic-free
3. Dishwasher safe
4. Drop resistant and leak proof
5. Match with your home aesthetics
